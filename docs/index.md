This is my personal website with notes. 

A lot of cool things I setup for learning japanese or other things in other hobbys or when I find cool resources, usually I forget how to do it properly in a while and all the tweaks I made for myself. This website helps me to archive these things and keep them accessible from any device.

Structure is very chaotic and not polished since website is focused on me. If you find something useful for you as well thats very nice and if you want to polish something or correct, improvements are welcome.
