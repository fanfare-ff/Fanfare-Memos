## Watch Anime
By far the easiest way to get by with low level of Japanese in my opinion.

## Reading Manga
I think manga is best read just as passive learning tool, just buy a physical copy on amazon.co.jp or second-hand via buyee. In my opinion it is enough just to have physical ocasional look ups via jisho.org and that's it. I also like using an app [Japanese Kanji Study](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindtwisted.kanjistudy) for offline look ups.

Why? There is not audio, sentences are too short and you still kinda get the plot because of the illustrations.
If you are a complete beginner though, it is an amazing tool.

I personally read Demon Slayer and kimi ni todoke as my first mangas. Especially kimi ni todoke was very enjoyable read even on N5 level.

## Reading Light Novels

This is the next huge step for reading, pure text, no pictures, descriptions.

Highly recommend go the digital route, you need a .epub. A lot of book sellers online force you to use their bullshit tools for reading, I suggest you buying the book digitally on kindle and then use nyaa.si or Anna's Archive to get an epub. Alternatively, you can convert your kindle via Calibre to epub. **If you enjoy the books and have some money to spare, have the dignity to support writers by buying digital or paperback copies**

After you got the file, you need a browser reader to read while using yomitan. ttsu ebook reader is perfect for this, just upload your file and start reading with usual yomitan look ups.

For your first couple of books I suggest to keep an english copy of the book in the side. Restrict yourself from looking at it too often. If something is really unclear, I read the english one once per logical section, for example the dialog or some scene finished. Otherwise, I reread the whole chapter in enhlish after finishing it in Japanese if I felt like I missed a lot of details and plot slips out.

For lookups if you feel like you just scanning the whole book with yomitan, don't use this book it is too difficult for now, try to read something easier, maybe more manga, watch anime or play some easy visual novel first. But also keep in mind the first books will be a nightmare anyway, so you cannot prepare yourself for this, just have a comprehension of at least to some degree.

I believe that light novels and visual novels are also the most effective way to boost your vocab and comrephension, so at some point you should move to this kind of material.

also while reading don't feel to bad when you skip stuff, like if you feel this description of a town is too specific, very painful to read and doesn't give you much, just skip it, it's okay.

For card creatiion, light novel cards tend to become very "dry" - no pictures, no audio, so my suggestions is to at least include a picture of related object for the card. If sentences are too difficult and you cannot find proper i+1, then try to learn some words by finding good sentences on https://www.immersionkit.com/dictionary.

For audio, use voisona or voicevox, guide is in tools section

I personally read Zero no Tsukaima as my first book, I don't actually recommend it. My second read was bunny senpai which included quite short description and a lot of dialogs which was enjoyable.

## Playing Visual Novels

I think of this like a great alternative to Light Novels. Visual Novels can be easier or more difficuly depending on the type and topic. Generally it is nicer for mining, because you always have some kind of visual and characters lines are typically voiced, so your AI voiceover can be reduced to a minimum for descriptions and protag lines.

To play the visual novel you need first to buy it. Use Steam, MangaGamer or JAST.

Then you need to install webhooker which doesn't work with every game unfortunately, you need to test is our yourself or look for lists of what is supported
This will help you to transfer the text to your web page for easy yomitan lookups

Then optionally you can use sharex to record the voicelines from VN logs and this way you will have a very nice workflow

Play Zero Escape and Steins;Gate
